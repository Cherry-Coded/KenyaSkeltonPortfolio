      <h2 class="box-header">Personal Life</h2>
      <div class="box-content">
        <p>I hail from the Pacific Northwest in Washington State with my partner and 2-year-old Lab-mix (that looks like Krypto the Superdog) named Beau. I love spending my time with stories. Books, Film, Tv, and any sort of comic I can get my hands on. So much so that I lose track of how many I'm keeping up with on a daily basis! My hidden talent after reading so many stories is that I can identify a killer pretty quickly in any mystery that asks for one. Also, I think of myself as a casual gamer. If I'm not dedicating my time to the woes of web development or a story of the sort I mentioned earlier, then I'm probably battling enemies on a virtual frontline.</p>

      <h2 class="box-header">Experience</h2>
      <div class="box-content">
        <p>I have 20 years of experience in the Performing Arts and a steady 9 years of Customer Service. After the Great Quarantine of 2020, I've had to shift my life a bit to also favor remote interests. Lately, I've been spending much of my time learning and developing skills in UI/UX Design. I've dabbled in the past with the ways of HTML and CSS courtesy of the age of social media during my teen years, but until recently, I'm pretty dedicated to getting better at front end development.</p>

      <h2 class="box-header">My Journey</h2>
      <div class="box-content">
        <p>If you asked me if I would ever take a chance on learning the tech field a year ago, I'd raise my eyebrow at you and laugh. Me coding? Right. Outside of finessing several blogs, I wasn't that interested. But, while I was sitting at home, unemployed and stressed about my future, I discovered G{Code} House. A program that helps foster and support people as they navigate through tech. It's one of the most supportive communities I've been part of. Their transparency and willingness to help you along your journey are top-notch. This experience has really opened my eyes a lot about what I can do. One day down the line, I'm hoping I can eventually make it to being a junior coder at a brilliant company here in the PNW, or even take my love of performing and stories and combine that with my coding skills to make an indie game. </p>
